I2C
----

    This module implements a standard I2C master interface.Since the main design goal is configuration and control of external
    integrated circuits, the implementation is not complete and only few features listed below have been worked on.

        - 100 kbit/s standard mode only
        - Master role only
        - 7 bit addressing only
        - Write support only

    The fundamental operation of the core is the register write operation, this is a 2 bytes write operation where the first byte
    represents the register address and the second one the value to be set.

    The internal structure of the module is shown in the image above. The control unit block is responsible for the Simplebus interface
    only, it consists of a state machine that accepts commands over that interface and then outputs the appropriate signals needed for
    the selected operation.
    Once a transfer is requested, the transfer controller takes over, this block, also containing a FSM, is at the core of the module
    operations, and it is responsible for the control of which data should go on the wire. It is also in charge of ensuring timing
    compliance with the standard controlling the spacing between transmissions. Lastly the data engine shifts the out of the core onto
    the SDA line when needed.
    The timebase signals is generated by the core of the :ref:`enable_gen` module, depending on the usage needs the timebase frequency
    can be either fixed and determined by a parameter or modifiable at runtime.

    **PARAMETERS**

        - **FIXED_PERIOD**:Enables fixed period mode. Default value "FALSE"
        - **FIXED_PERIOD_WIDTH**: This parameter controls the SCL frequency when fixed period mode is enabled. Default value 1000
        - **SCL_TIMEBASE_DELAY**: This parameter controls the amount of delay in clock cycles between the timebase edge and the output scl edge 15

    **INPUTS**

        - **clock**: Main clock input
        - **reset**: Active low synchronous reset input
        - **sb_address**: Simplebus slave address signal
        - **sb_read_strobe**: Simplebus slave read_strobe signal
        - **sb_write_strobe**: Simplebus slave write strobe signal
        - **sb_write_data**: Simplebus slave write data signal
        - **i2c_scl_in**: I2C SCL input, used in conjunction with an external tristate IO buffer
        - **i2c_sda_in**: I2C SDA input, used in conjunction with an external tristate IO buffer

    **OUTPUTS**

        - **sb_ready**: Simplebus slave ready signal
        - **sb_read_data**: Simplebus slave read data signal
        - **i2c_scl_out**: I2C SCL output, used in conjunction with an external tristate IO buffer
        - **i2c_scl_out_en**: I2C SCL output eable, used to control an external tristate IO buffer
        - **i2c_sda_out**: I2C SDA output, used in conjunction with an external tristate IO buffer
        - **i2c_sda_out_en**: I2C SDA output eable, used to control an external tristate IO buffer

SPI
----



    This module implements a standard SPI peripheral. The main configuration and control is done through the Simplebus Interface, however
    once configured the data transfers can also be fully controlled through the external AXI stream interface

    .. danger:: The control of the module through the external_transfer_start and external_transfer_length signals is deprecated and will soon be removed

    The operations of this module are controlled by the Control Unit. This sub-module interfaces to the outside world through the
    Simplebus Interface and controls all other aspects of the core. This also listens on the AXI steam interface and starts transfers
    as necessary. As in all SPI interfaces the design revolves around a parallel to serial shift register (SPI register here).
    This is directly controlled by the Transfer engine, who controls the transmission length, the timing and polarity of slave select signals,
    the endianness of transfered data etc. An internal enable generator allows totally standalone periodic transfers operations.
    The basic timing is derived from the input clock through a prescaler.

    **PARAMETERS**

        - **BASE_ADDRESS**:Base address for the Sipmplebus interface. Default value 0x43C00000
        - **SS_POLARITY_DEFAULT**: State of the Slave select signals upon reset. Default value 0

    **INPUTS**

        - **clock**: Main clock input
        - **reset**: Active low synchronous reset input
        - **sb_address**: Simplebus slave address signal
        - **sb_read_strobe**: Simplebus slave read_strobe signal
        - **sb_write_strobe**: Simplebus slave write strobe signal
        - **sb_write_data**: Simplebus slave write data signal
        - **external_transfer_start**: A rising edge on this signal will trigger a transfer
        - **external_transfer_length**: Length of the SPI transfer whenn externally triggered
        - **MISO**: Master Input Slave Output SPI signal
        - **SCLK**: Slave Clock SPI signal
        - **SPI_write_valid**: AXI stream slave transfer control interface valid signal
